[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-Paper-green)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20799)

**SFE-Net** is a deep learning framework inspired by biological principles of differential gene expression, designed to improve feature selection and adaptability for robust **DeepFake detection** across various datasets.

## üìù Abstract

DeepFake detection faces challenges from diverse synthesis methods like **Faceswap**, **Deepfakes**, **Face2Face**, and **NeuralTextures**, which traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize across. Inspired by **differential gene expression** in biological systems, **SFE-Net** introduces a novel mechanism to dynamically prioritize critical features while suppressing irrelevant cues. This results in enhanced generalization and performance across varied DeepFake generation techniques.

Key highlights:
- Bio-inspired **Selective Feature Activation** for dynamic response.
- Rigorous cross-dataset testing to ensure robustness.
- Superior performance in mitigating overfitting and improving generalizability.

## üìã Methodology

The architecture of SFE-Net is divided into the following stages:
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Input videos are converted into frames, masks, and landmarks for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extracts five key features:
     - **Lico**: Light consistency feature.
     - **Hifr**: High-frequency feature.
     - **Comr**: Compression-reconstruction feature.
     - **Moop**: Morphological operation feature.
     - **Text**: Texture feature.
3. **Selective Expression**:
   - Inspired by gene expression, dynamically adjusts feature prioritization.
4. **Classification**:
   - Final layer predicts the authenticity (`Real` or `Fake`) of the video.
